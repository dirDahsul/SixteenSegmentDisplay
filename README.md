## Overview
The Sixteen-Segment Display Library is designed to simplify the process of displaying characters on a sixteen-segment display. Each character is encoded as a set of segment states (on or off), allowing for easy rendering of text.

## Features
- Display individual characters on a sixteen-segment display.
- Support for a wide range of characters including uppercase, lowercase, and special characters.
- Buffer method for efficient display updates.
- Easy integration with hardware interfaces.

## Future Improvements
Enhanced Screen Writing Method: Improve the method to rewrite the entire screen efficiently, reducing flicker and latency.
Optimized Buffer Method: Modify the buffer to store the segment code instead of buffering the entire segment state. This will improve memory usage and update performance.
Additional Character Support: Expand the library to support more characters and possibly custom character encoding.
